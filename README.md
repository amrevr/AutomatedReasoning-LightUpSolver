## Baseline rules for the game

## How to setup
- This program was tested and run on miniconda 3 and python version 3.11.4 
- It utilizes dowloaded modules of z3, numpy, os, and time
  - All required modules are either included with python or can be dowloaded by running the installation.py file we have included

## How to run
- To run this program, run main.py
- You should see a prompt in the terminal asking which file number you would like to run
- Select a prompt and you will see the solver run through the steps to generate a solution to the game
- You can verify the correctness of the solution through the online link provided at the end of the program
